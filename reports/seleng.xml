        <title>Work Report</title>
        <simpara>
            My work as a team leader was to split job between all the team members. Before it, we discuss, what
            everybody is able to do, or what he is able to learn to do.

            As a team leader I was also responsible for creating and managing the project's repository on github and
            giving advices about using git. Later I decided to find some free hosting, which supports Tomcat server, so
            our application can run in the cloud. I found out that "Openshift" by Red Hat is exactly what we need. After
            finishing all the Java stuff, I spent a lot of time trying to find out how does the Openshift work and how
            to deploy an application to it as well.

        <simpara>
            As I have already mentioned, I was responsible for Java backend of an application. This was not for the
            first time, I was writing such a servlet, but i have never been handling inputs from editor, before, what
            has shown up as very easy job.

            Last thing, I have participated in, was creating svg files for Raspberry Pi, as well as editing it to create
            common board.
